# leaflet-challenge

#### This project utlizes a data set (updated every 5 mintutes) from the United States Geological Survery (USGS) and provides a geographical visualization of earthquake activity in the past seven days.

Data was extracted from JSON, a map using Leaflet was created that plots all of the earthquakes in the dataset based on their longitude and latitudes.  

The map includes markers that reflect the magnitude of each earthquake by their size and depth.  Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and 
earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.
